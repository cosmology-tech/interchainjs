# Auth vs. Wallet

```ts filename="From @sign/core"
interface Auth {
  key: Key;
  sign: (data: Uint8Array) => SigObj;
  verify: (data: Uint8Array, sigObj: SigObj) => boolean;
}
```

```ts filename="From @sign/cosmjs"
interface Wallet {
  getAccounts: () => AccountData[];
  signAmino: (signerAddress: string, signDoc: StdSignDoc) => AminoSignResponse;
  signDirect: (signerAddress: string, signDoc: SignDoc) => DirectSignResponse;
}
```

| Interface | Implementing Class | Used By Class            |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `Auth`    | `Secp256k1Auth`    | `Signer` ; `AminoSigner` |
| `Wallet`  | `Secp256k1Wallet`  | `CosmjsSigner`           |

> `Wallet` in `CosmjsSigner` is called `OfflineSigner` to keep the same with `cosmjs`

## Similarities

1. They're both the underlying signing entity for various `sign` methods in signers.

## Differences

1. An `Auth` object only stands for **a HdPath**, while a `Wallet` object can stand for **multiple HdPaths**. That's why the property _getAccounts_ in `Wallet` is plural. And _signerAddress_ in arguments of _signAmino_ and _signDirect_ is used to determine which _Account (HdPath)_ is adopted for signing.
